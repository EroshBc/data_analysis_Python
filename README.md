Dataset : Kaggle dataset "The big dataset of ultra-marathon running" used. 
**https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aiaiaidavid/the-big-dataset-of-ultra-marathon-running?resource=download**

**The data in this file is a large collection of ultra-marathon race records registered between 1798 and 2022**
**Despite the original data being of public domain, the race records, which originally contained the athlete´s names, have been anonymized to comply with data protection laws and to preserve the athlete´s privacy. However, a column Athlete ID has been created with a numerical ID representing each unique runner (so if Antonio Fernández participated in 5 races over different years, then the corresponding race records now hold his unique Athlete ID instead of his name).**
